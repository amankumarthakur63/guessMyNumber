# Guess My Number 🎯

Welcome to the **Guess My Number** game, a simple and interactive number-guessing game built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**! This project showcases dynamic DOM manipulation, event handling, and game logic implementation, making it a great example of front-end development skills.

## 🚀 Features

- **Random Number Generation**: A secret number is randomly generated between 1 and 20.
- **Dynamic Feedback**: Real-time feedback on guesses (e.g., "Too high!", "Too low!", "Correct Number!").
- **Score Tracking**: Keeps track of the player's score and high score.
- **Game Reset**: Allows players to restart the game at any time.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive layout for desktop and mobile devices.

## 🎮 How to Play

1. **Objective**: Guess the secret number between 1 and 20.
2. **Make a Guess**: Enter your guess in the input field and click the **Check!** button.
   - If your guess is correct, you win the game!
   - If your guess is too high or too low, you'll receive feedback and lose one point.
3. **Restart the Game**: Click the **Again!** button to reset the game and try again.
4. **High Score**: Try to beat your previous high score by guessing the number with fewer attempts.
